## GNOME theme for Firefox

(This is the theme previously known as "Adwaita".)

An easy-to-install version of this theme is available at 
[Mozilla's ADD-ONS site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adwaita).  
Bleeding edge releases are available [here](https://launchpad.net/gnome-integration/firefox-gnome/firefox-gnome-releases).

We recommend [HTitle](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/htitle) 
for the full GNOME 3 experience.

For current issues please see the 
[bug tracker](https://github.com/lbrfabio/firefox-gnome-flat/issues).

Help & feedback are both appreciated! ;-)

If you'd like to change tab positions or any additional settings, 
please install [GNOME Theme Tweak](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-theme-tweak/)
(an extension we also make).
