## GNOME theme for Firefox

(This is the theme previously known as "Adwaita".)

An easy-to-install version of this theme is available at 
[Mozilla's ADD-ONS site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adwaita).  
Bleeding edge releases are available [here](https://launchpad.net/gnome-integration/firefox-gnome/firefox-gnome-releases).

For current issues please see the 
[bug tracker](https://github.com/lbrfabio/firefox-gnome-flat/issues).

Help & feedback are both appreciated! ;-)

```

Available targets: _all_, _theme_, _extension_ and _clean_. Default is _all_.
